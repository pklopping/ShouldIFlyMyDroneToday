##About

This is a simple single-page app designed to let drone pilots determine if the weather is suitable for flying at a given geo location. 

This app will be written using jQuery, HAML, SASS, and Coffescript. 


##Usage

To run this app, clone it into your desired directory and open index.html in a browser.  Installation on a web server is just as simple.

To modify this app, you'll need to know SASS, Coffeescript, and HAML, and you'll also need to have the appropriate compilers. As you make changes, you should just need to run the appropriate compilation scripts (found in `/scripts`) and then reload the page.
